## 🧩 Description

This program implements the **DFA minimization algorithm** described in *Kozen (1997), Lecture 14*.  
The algorithm identifies **equivalent states** in a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) and prints them in lexicographical order.

The implementation is based on the **table-filling algorithm with dependency propagation**, which marks non-equivalent state pairs and determines equivalent ones.

## ⚙️ Algorithm Explanation

1. **Mark initial pairs:**  
   Mark all pairs `(p, q)` where one state is final and the other is not.

2. **Build dependencies:**  
   For every pair `(p, q)` and every symbol `a` in the alphabet, track which pairs depend on `(δ(p, a), δ(q, a))`.

3. **Propagate marks:**  
   Using a queue (BFS), propagate the "non-equivalence" marks to all dependent pairs.

4. **Find equivalent states:**  
   Pairs that remain unmarked are equivalent states and are printed in lexicographical order.

## 🧮 Input Format

Each test case represents a DFA **without inaccessible states**, described as follows:

1. Number of states `n`  
2. The alphabet symbols (separated by spaces)  
3. The final states (separated by spaces)  
4. `n` lines describing the transition table.  
   Each line has one destination per symbol (in the same order as the alphabet).

Example input:

4
6
a b
1 2 5
0 1 2
1 3 4
2 4 3
3 5 5
4 5 5
5 5 5

## 🧾 Output Format

For each test case, the program prints one line with the pairs of equivalent states, separated by spaces:

Example output:
(1, 2) (3, 4)
